# Project Portfolio - Natacha Aviat

Welcome to my online portfolio! This repository showcases my projects in **data visualization**, **interactive mapping**, and **web tool development**.

## 🎯 Portfolio Objectives

This portfolio has two complementary goals:

1. **Professional Catalog** : Showcase my skills in data analysis and visualization to develop my **freelance** activity
2. **Non-profit Projects** : Provide access to tools developed for the **MaMaMa association** and other social impact projects

The two can intersect: I can create maps and data analyses for MaMaMa, but also develop operational tools for other organizations.
